# Enterprise sign-in and identity management

Ordivant Work, Knowledge, and Code share one Identity service. Administrators can connect an existing enterprise OIDC identity service and control member provisioning, product and Project permissions, sign-in policy, and sessions. Enterprise passwords and MFA are handled by the identity service; Ordivant does not receive enterprise passwords.

## Administrator setup

1. Create and sign in with the first administrator for the environment you intend to use. Development and production environments have separate accounts, SSO settings, and databases.
2. Open “Accounts and security → Enterprise SSO.” Choose an identity provider template, then enter the organization-specific Issuer URL, Client ID, and Client Secret.
3. Create a confidential OIDC web application in the identity service with Authorization Code and PKCE S256 enabled. Register the complete Callback URL shown by Ordivant as a Redirect URI; do not use wildcards.
4. Configure allowed full email domains, member provisioning, default permissions, and group mappings. Save, then run “Test connection.” This checks discovery and JWKS; actual sign-in still requires authorization by the identity service.
5. Validate sign-in, product access, and sign-out with one enterprise member before enabling “Enterprise SSO only.” The local administrator credentials remain available as a recovery path.

Leaving Client Secret blank preserves the existing value; changing the Issuer or Client ID requires you to enter a new value explicitly. After saving, the interface clears the Secret and the API returns only whether one is configured. The configured canonical origin is the public source of truth. If sign-in starts from another localhost or `127.0.0.1` alias, the interface first redirects to that origin.

## Common identity providers

| Identity provider | Issuer / application settings | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Microsoft Entra ID | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/TENANT_ID/v2.0`; Web platform, organization-specific tenant | Use an explicit tenant. Choose `email` or `preferred_username` based on actual token claims. If Entra does not provide `email_verified`, disable that check only after confirming tenant and domain policy. Administrators must configure group claims; group overage is not treated as group authorization. |
| Google Workspace | `https://accounts.google.com`; Web application OAuth client | Restrict allowed domains; the IdP's `hd` hint does not replace backend domain checks. Google does not provide the groups needed by the product by default; configure explicit default permissions or assign access manually. |
| Okta | The organization's own OIDC authorization-server issuer | Configure a groups claim in the ID token. Group names must exactly match the permission mapping. |
| Auth0 | `https://YOUR_TENANT.REGION.auth0.com/` or a configured custom domain | Uses standard OIDC ID-token claims. To use groups, add a custom claim with an Action and enter the same claim name in Ordivant. |
| Keycloak | `https://IDP_HOST/realms/REALM` | Use a confidential client, PKCE S256, and a groups mapper in the ID token. Keycloak can broker SAML or LDAP/AD. |
| Other OIDC providers | The exact issuer exposed by the service | Must provide discovery, JWKS, Authorization Code, a signed ID token, and usable identity claims. |

These templates provide standard setup patterns. A real enterprise tenant still needs sign-in validation with that organization's configuration; passing a local Keycloak test does not mean every vendor tenant has passed.

## Members and permissions

- **Invitation only:** An administrator first creates a member invitation. After the enterprise email is verified and matches an allowed domain, the member can accept the invitation through SSO and receives the product and resource permissions specified in it. Enterprise sign-in does not create administrators automatically.
- **JIT provisioning:** The first sign-in creates a regular member with explicit default and group permissions. Members without configured permissions cannot access product data; sharing a domain does not grant organization-wide visibility.
- **Group synchronization:** JIT-managed members have their groups synchronized at every sign-in. Removing a group removes the related grants and revokes existing sessions. Each product's Python service continues to enforce data access.
- **Existing account linking:** Matching email addresses do not merge accounts automatically. An administrator must explicitly map an existing user to an IdP subject, which is verified at sign-in. Unlinking revokes the enterprise sign-in session.
- **Manual permissions:** When an administrator explicitly changes a member's permissions, those permissions become manually managed so the next sign-in does not silently overwrite them. To resume group management, set the management mode again through the identity link.

Successful sign-in creates a platform session only; it does not grant credentials for Agents or version-control services. Agent REST/MCP continues to use separate project-scoped identities.

## SAML, LDAP, and Active Directory

Ordivant uses OIDC as its integration protocol. Enterprises with only SAML or LDAP/AD can use the optional Keycloak identity broker: configure a SAML Identity Provider or LDAP User Federation in Keycloak, then connect its exposed OIDC realm to Ordivant. Work, Knowledge, and Code do not each need to store LDAP passwords or implement different sign-in protocols.

For SAML, add a SAML Identity Provider in Keycloak and import the upstream metadata. Register the broker's Entity ID and ACS/Redirect URI with the upstream provider. Keep assertion signature validation enabled, configure email and name mappers, and decide whether to enable Trust Email according to the enterprise email-verification policy. Configure a separate broker mapper for groups so the final OIDC ID token's groups claim contains the complete group names mapped in Ordivant. SAML groups do not automatically become platform permissions.

For LDAP/AD, add an LDAP provider under Keycloak User Federation. Enter the directory address, Users DN, search filters, and username/email attributes provided by the enterprise. Configure group mappers and use LDAPS or StartTLS with a trusted CA. Enterprise administrators enter directory bind credentials and member passwords directly in the identity service. Validate the directory connection and synchronization for one member before creating an OIDC client for Ordivant. Ordivant still applies allowed domains, invitation/JIT policy, and explicit resource grants.

The container configuration provides pinned Keycloak 26.8.0 and a separate PostgreSQL database:

```powershell
.\scripts\containers.ps1 -Action up -WithIdentityBroker
```

By default, the broker binds only to `127.0.0.1:8093`. The caller can set `ORDIVANT_BROKER_PORT` and `ORDIVANT_BROKER_PUBLIC_URL`; deployments across machines should use a fixed HTTPS URL and a trusted reverse proxy. Other OIDC providers can be configured directly without enabling the broker container.

The broker does not create a default human administrator. During initialization, enter the password at the interactive prompt in a WSL tmux session:

```powershell
wsl -- tmux new-session -A -s ordivant-idp-admin
```

In that terminal, use the actual Compose project name (the example below uses local production mode):

```bash
cd '/path/to/ordivant'  # In Windows WSL, use a path such as /mnt/c/path/to/ordivant.
export ORDIVANT_SECRETS_DIR="$PWD/.data/container-secrets/ordivant-local"
docker compose -p ordivant-local -f compose.yaml -f compose.identity-broker.yaml --profile identity-broker stop identity-broker
docker compose -p ordivant-local -f compose.yaml -f compose.identity-broker.yaml --profile identity-broker run --rm identity-broker bootstrap-admin user --username temp-admin
docker compose -p ordivant-local -f compose.yaml -f compose.identity-broker.yaml --profile identity-broker up -d identity-broker
```

Enter the password only at the prompt; do not put it in chat, commands, environment variables, or files. Sign in to the broker as the temporary administrator, create the permanent administrator, then remove the temporary account. Docker Desktop integration must be enabled for WSL. See [Keycloak's official bootstrap and recovery guide](https://www.keycloak.org/server/bootstrap-admin-recovery).

## Sessions, security, and audit

The platform uses HttpOnly, SameSite, and Origin/CSRF protections. OIDC uses one-time state, browser binding, nonce, PKCE S256, and signature/issuer/audience validation. Client Secrets are encrypted at rest; authorization codes, ID tokens, and access tokens are not written to business databases, API responses, or sign-in logs.

Disabling an account, changing permissions, unlinking an enterprise identity, or disabling/replacing an identity provider revokes the related sessions. SSO-only mode revokes regular members' password sessions. If the IdP supports OIDC Back-Channel Logout, configure its URL as `https://APP_HOST/auth-api/oidc/backchannel-logout`. Only logout notifications that pass signature and replay checks can revoke the matching enterprise sign-in.

Signing out of Ordivant revokes the session shared by its three modules; the IdP manages sessions in other enterprise applications. Configure enterprise MFA, Conditional Access, password policies, and offboarding in the IdP. If the IdP does not send back-channel logout, administrators must also disable the member in Ordivant; disabling an IdP account alone does not immediately invalidate an existing platform session.

The “Identity audit” records sign-ins, provisioning, settings and permission changes, linking/unlinking, and sign-outs. Only administrators can view it. It contains no passwords, cookies, Client Secrets, or provider tokens.

## Operations and backups

Preserve Identity PostgreSQL, `identity_data` (including `sso.key`), and Compose service secrets. When using the broker, also preserve `identity_broker_postgres`. Back up databases with their encryption keys; a database alone cannot restore an encrypted Client Secret.

For production HTTPS, set `ORDIVANT_AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true`, `ORDIVANT_AUTH_ORIGINS`, and `ORDIVANT_SSO_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` explicitly. If the token or JWKS endpoint found through provider discovery uses a different host, use `ORDIVANT_SSO_ALLOWED_ENDPOINT_HOSTS` to list additional trusted hosts. The exact Google HTTPS token/JWKS hosts are supported. A private HTTP broker requires explicit `ORDIVANT_SSO_HTTP_HOSTS`; `-WithIdentityBroker` configures back-channel routing on that Compose network, and external providers do not need this exception.

For a private enterprise CA, mount its PEM trust bundle into the Identity container and set `ORDIVANT_SSO_CA_BUNDLE` to the file path; TLS certificate verification remains enabled. Compose trusts the designated `web` proxy, whose Nginx instance overwrites `X-Real-IP` so sign-in rate limits use the actual source. A custom reverse proxy must be listed by exact host/IP in `ORDIVANT_AUTH_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOSTS` and must overwrite this header; forged headers sent directly to the Identity API are ignored.

Native SAML protocol endpoints, automatic SCIM 2.0 offboarding synchronization, and integration acceptance for specific enterprise tenants are separate future work. See `sso-validation.md` for actual acceptance of the SAML identity broker and main OIDC flow.

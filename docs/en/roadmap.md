# Roadmap and feature boundaries {#roadmap-and-feature-boundaries}

This page explains what is available today and what is not supported yet. It does not promise delivery dates. Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ordivant-ai/ordivant/issues) to suggest needs, discuss them, or follow progress; a request does not guarantee development.

## Available today {#delivered-in-v0-1}

- **Work:** Create projects and tasks, assign agents, set task ordering, and review activity and submitted results. Workflows can be started manually or scheduled at minute intervals.
- **Knowledge:** Keep document versions, search text, record decisions, and cite exact sources.
- **Code (optional):** Collaborate on code with Gitea. Work can also show merge-request information from a configured Git service.
- **Sign-in and permissions:** Use regular accounts or enterprise OIDC single sign-on. SAML and LDAP / Active Directory can be connected through the optional Keycloak integration.
- **External tools:** Administrators can configure MCP tools that use an access token.
- **Execution isolation:** Docker work environments deny network access by default, but share the host kernel and are not equivalent to virtual machines.
- **Review:** A different authorized person must independently review submitted results before a task is complete.

## Current limits and possible directions {#candidates-for-future-work}

| Area | Available now | Not supported yet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Work execution | One execution service handles work. | Distributing work across multiple execution services or scaling them automatically. |
| Approval before actions | A different person can review submitted results. | A pre-approval flow that covers all actions taken through external tools. |
| Model usage and cost | Set per-response output, run-turn, and time limits; view usage records. | Reliable price calculation across all providers or a hard organization-wide spending limit. |
| Notifications and code checks | View run events and reported check results. | Built-in email or chat notifications, or a code build service. |
| Account management | Control access through OIDC groups and account disabling. | Automatic user and group synchronization through SCIM. |
| External tool sign-in | Connect MCP tools using an access token. | Interactive tool sign-in or Agent-to-Agent (A2A) connections. |
| Knowledge import | Save and search text documents. | Automatic document parsing, image text recognition, semantic indexing, or batch source synchronization. |
| Sandbox isolation | Docker execution denies network access by default and shares the host kernel. | Virtual-machine-level isolation or execution distributed across multiple services. |

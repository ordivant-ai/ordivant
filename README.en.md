# Ordivant

[繁體中文](README.md) · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) · **English**

**An open-source, self-hosted collaboration platform for agents.** Connect tasks, knowledge, code, and execution evidence in workflows that can be reviewed independently.

Ordivant brings projects, versioned knowledge, code provenance, durable runs, and independent review together in a self-hosted platform. The application and documentation support Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and English.

## What you can do

| Product | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| **Work** | Project and task collaboration, Agent assignment and delegation, evidence, and independent review |
| **Runs and automation** | Agent execution controls, workflows, reusable templates, and isolated tools |
| **Knowledge** | Versioned documents, decisions, search, and source citations |
| **Code** | Repositories, commits, pull requests, and check status; Gitea is optional |
| **Identity** | Sign-in, invitations, product permissions, enterprise OIDC, and optional SAML/LDAP broker |

Work can read configured GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea directly; it does not require the Code product. Products can be used independently or as a full Suite.

## Quick start

You need **Git, Docker Engine, and Docker Compose v2**. Use Docker Desktop on Windows or macOS, or Docker Engine on Linux. From the repository root, run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ordivant-ai/ordivant.git
cd ordivant
docker compose -f compose.init.yaml run --rm init
docker compose up -d --build --wait
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8088** and create the first human administrator in your browser. There is no default human account or password. The default deployment name is `ordivant`, and the web port is `8088`. The main setup does not add DEMO data or configure a model.

An administrator can configure a provider, API key, and model on the model management page; see the [model connection guide](docs/en/model-usage.md). To run Agents, enable Runtime separately using the [container deployment guide](docs/en/containers.md). Without a valid model connection, Runs are marked DEMO; this does not mean a paid model was called. The container guide also covers optional Gitea and Sandbox, backups, and HTTPS.

```sh
docker compose ps
docker compose down
```

`docker compose down` stops services and preserves data volumes. Do not add `-v` unless you intend to delete the data. GitHub Pages hosts static documentation; you deploy the platform services yourself.

## Language

Switch among **Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and English** on the sign-in page and below product navigation. The selection is saved in the current browser and shared across Work, Knowledge, and Code; switching languages does not clear forms. User-created tasks, documents, messages, and code remain in their original language. The documentation site's top-right language switch opens the same article in another language. See [Language and translation](docs/en/i18n.md).

## Release and boundaries

The current release is **v0.1.0 early public release**. Knowledge uses text search; a Code status receipt does not represent built-in CI test results. Enterprise IdP, Git, model providers, and public HTTPS environments should be validated by the deployment team. See the [roadmap](docs/en/roadmap.md) and [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for known limitations and future plans.
